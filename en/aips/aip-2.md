# AIP-2: Authority Signature Validation

- **Author**: Actio Core Team  
- **Status**: Final  
- **Created**: 2025-06-29

## Overview

This AIP defines how the Actio Protocol validates that action codes and transaction memos are signed by a trusted protocol authority. This ensures that codes cannot be spoofed, reused, or injected from unauthorized sources.

## Motivation

To protect users and service providers from fraudulent or tampered action codes, and to maintain a secure trust model across apps using the Actio Protocol.

## Specification

### Requirements for Validation

1. The `iss` (issuer) field in the memo must match the expected protocol authority public key.
2. The code or action request must be signed using the authorityâ€™s private key.
3. The signature must be verifiable against the code payload (or memo) and the public key (`iss`).
4. The verifier must fetch the current trusted authority list (initially from `https://service.ota.codes/.well-known/authority-registry.json`).

### Validation Steps

1. Parse the memo string from the transaction.
2. Extract the `iss` field and fetch the authority list.
3. Verify that `iss` is included in the trusted authorities.
4. Validate the cryptographic signature against the code body.

## Example Use

When a dApp receives an incoming transaction with a memo:
- It extracts the `actioncodes:` memo.
- Validates that the `iss` field is trusted.
- Uses the signature embedded in the code (or payload) to validate authenticity.

## Notes

- Signature format and structure are defined in AIP-0 and AIP-1.
- Future protocol versions may allow rotating authorities or delegating issuance to wallets.
